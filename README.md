# Emendatus Enigmatica-no-mekanism
This mod is created to help unifying some items, blocks, and ores that are common among the most used mods. This mod provide little to no functionality as a stand-alone mod. It does however offer a wide range of options for Modpack authors to utilize these blocks, and items as a method of unification. All blocks, and items have been properly tagged, and have all the basic recipes. This mod also includes a world gen of ores that match the strata provided by other mods such as Create and Quark.

This is a fork removing the Mekanism compatability for a modpack without Mekanism.
